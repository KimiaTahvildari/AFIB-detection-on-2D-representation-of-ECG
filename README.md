# AFIB-detection-on-2D-representation-of-ECG
The aim of the work is to compare 3 types of 2-dimensional representation of the ECG signal constituting the input to the atrial fibrillation detector built on the basis of convolutional networks. To carry out the experiment, publicly available databases containing atrial fibrillation class markers should be used. The databases should be divided into training, validation and test sets. The results should be summarized using standard diagnostic measures: TPR, PPV, FPR, as well as ROC and Precision-Recall charts. Based on the analysis of the results, a recommendation should be made for the approach that gives the best results in the context of detecting atrial fibrillation with the Conv2D network.
